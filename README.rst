**MNE-NIRS** is an `MNE <https://mne.tools>`_ compatible near-infrared spectroscopy processing package. 

MNE has support for some common analysis procedures (see `tutorial <https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/preprocessing/plot_70_fnirs_processing.html>`_), this package adds additional helper functions, algorithms, and plotting. Functionality that is widely used from this package may be merged in to MNE.
